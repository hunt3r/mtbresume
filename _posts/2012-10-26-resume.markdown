My name is Christopher Hunter, I'm writing to you regarding your 2013 bicycle sponsorship program. I'd like to tell you about myself and my background in racing.  I'm a BS graduate from Drexel University, as well as an Engineering Manager at Urban Outfitters.  I'm a cat 1 DH and [former professional motocross racer](http://vault.racerxonline.com/rider/chris-d-hunter/races) with over 15 years racing experience.  I also spent a lot of time in my teenage years racing and riding BMX up into the 15 expert class.  I have represented many well known companies in the past and would love to have the opportunity to bring this level of professionalism to {company} in the 2013 Gravity East, Category 1 Downhill class next season.

I started mountain biking about seven years ago with some friends that I had previously raced motocross with, and really fell in love with the simplicity of it.  It was a nice replacement for motocross while I got my degree, but it quickly became much more than that. Traveling on MTB trips became a big part of my life, Whistler, Highland Bike Park, Moab, Highland, Mountain Creek, and many others have become seasonal destinations for myself and my friends. 

I had a pretty good season this year with several wins and top 3's in the Gravity East series as well as the SDS freeride series.

By helping to re-open and rebuild Spring Mountain's Launch Bike Park.  Along with my years of MTB Advocacy work in the Philadelphia Region, I have met and remain in contact with a lot of really amazing people through these endeavors. These connections will bring value to any potential engagement between myself and {company}.
